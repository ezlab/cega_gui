<p>
  CEGA, (Conserved Elements from Genomic Alignments), is a database of conserved vertebrate elements.
  The aim of this database is to provide acces to precomputed sets of conserved sequences from different species
  and at different levels of the vertebrate phylogeny.
  The identification of these conserved elements is based on the delineation of colinear blocks of 5 representative species (including human and one species at the root level of the clade), the multiple sequence alignment of these blocks using a global-local strategy (Mlagan) and the subsequent computation of elements using PhastCons.
